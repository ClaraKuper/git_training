	- What is git: version control system
	- Track history, work together
	- centralized vs. distributed version control systems (central server vs. individual copies)
	
	- command line git (fast), gui (also nice)
	- configuring git, set name, mail, default editor
	- set default editor - editor added to global path, git config --global -core.editot "name --wait"
	- end of line setting to imput for mac and linux, set to true for windows
	
	- https://git-scm.com/docs/ is the git documentation.
	- git "command" --help = long help documentation
	- git "commanf" -h = short help documentation
	
	=========
	SNAPSHOTS
	=========
	
	git folder is hidden in directory, can be shown with flag -a
	.git folder has all the history and should not be touched!
	
	========
	WORKFLOW
	========
	
	git repo is a hidden subdirectory in project directory
	creating a commit = taking a project snapshot
	staging area/index -> allows for review before commit
	add file1 file2 to put files into staging
	REVIEW BEFORE COMMIT 
	commit with message
	commiting does NOT clean the staging area! 
	
	changes in local folder will not yet be in staging.
	each commit has a id
	- what was changed
	- who changed
	- full project content! BUT compressed, and NO duplicates
	
	commits without messages will open default editor to add messages.
	
	=====================
	COMMIT BEST PRACTICES
	=====================
	
	Commit often, but not too often (every time you reach a point you might like to return to).
	make commits logical parts
	logically structured commits make it easier to find commit messages
	use present tense
	
	============
	SKIP STAGING
	============
	
	Not really recommended.
	
	==============
	DELETING FILES
	==============
	
	git ls-files show files in staging area
	git rm removes files from working directory and staging areas simultaneously
	
	============
	RENAME FILES
	============
	
	renaming is a double-step operation -> deleting the old file, and adding a new file. 
	both changes need to be staged and committed! 
	
	*********************************************************
	* When renaming, make sure the renamed files isn't open *
