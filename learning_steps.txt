	- What is git: version control system
	- Track history, work together
	- centralized vs. distributed version control systems (central server vs. individual copies)
	
	- command line git (fast), gui (also nice)
	- configuring git, set name, mail, default editor
	- set default editor - editor added to global path, git config --global -core.editot "name --wait"
	- end of line setting to imput for mac and linux, set to true for windows
	
	- https://git-scm.com/docs/ is the git documentation.

	=========
	SNAPSHOTS
	=========
	
	git folder is hidden in directory, can be shown with flag -a
	.git folder has all the history and should not be touched!
	
	========
	WORKFLOW
	========
	
	git repo is a hidden subdirectory in project directory
	creating a commit = taking a project snapshot
	staging area/index -> allows for review before commit
	add file1 file2 to put files into staging
	REVIEW BEFORE COMMIT 
	commit with message
	commiting does NOT clean the staging area! 
	
	changes in local folder will not yet be in staging.
